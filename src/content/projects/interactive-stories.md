I was a part of a team responible for an interactive storybook platform used by over a million children across Germany. Children use it to learn how to read by reading books with engaging games and quizzes intermingled with the text. Its backend was written in Vanilla Node.js (the horror, I know), backed by MongoDB, and was consumed by a React frontend, an Elm back office application, and a mobile app developed by an external company.

Worked on an application for a German manufacturing company to manage every step of their rug manufacturing process, from design briefing,
designs, feedback and iteration, all the way to production files. This project digitalized their existing paper processes with their network of external designers and studios.
It also utilized Adobe's Photoshop API to programmatically create photos of their rug designs in model homes for sales catalogs.

title: Realtime Time Clock for Pharmacies
description: 'Worked with a team responsible for the maintenance and further development of a Pharmacy Management application. I built a realtime time clock dashboard that allowed pharmacy employees to clock in and out of work, record breaks, and provide an overview of present employees for management. This was a part of a broader effort to build out shift planning, vacation management, and time tracking and reporting within the larger system.'
